## February 2025 - Reka UI & npx shadcn-vue@latest init

We've updated the latest registry to support Reka UI instead of Radix Vue.

The updated CLI is now available. You can now install components, themes, composables, utils and more using `npx shadcn-vue add`.

This is a major step towards distributing code that you and your LLMs can access and use.

<Callout icon="⚠️">

With the released of [Reka UI v2](https://reka-ui.com/), `shadcn-vue@latest` command will now install Reka UI. If you want to keep using [Radix Vue](https://radix-vue.com/), please visit [here](https://radix.shadcn-vue.com/) and run `shadcn-vue@radix` command instead.

</Callout>

1. First up, when you init into a new app, we update your existing Tailwind files instead of overriding.
2. A component now ship its own dependencies. Take the accordion for example, it can define its Tailwind keyframes. When you add it to your project, we’ll update your tailwind.config.ts file accordingly.
3. You can also install remote components using url. `npx shadcn-vue add https://acme.com/registry/navbar.json`.
<!-- 4. We have also improve the init command. It does framework detection and can even init a brand new Next.js app in one command. `npx shadcn init`. -->
4. We have created a new schema that you can use to ship your own component registry. And since it has support for urls, you can even use it to distribute private components.
5. And a few more updates like better error handling and monorepo support.

You can try the new cli today.

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest init Sidebar01 Login01
```

### Update Your Project

<Steps>

### Update `components.json`

To update an existing project to use the new CLI, update your `components.json` file to include import aliases for your **components**, **utils**, **ui**, **lib** and **composables**.

```json:line-numbers {7-13} title="components.json" inert
{
  "$schema": "https://shadcn-vue.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "tailwind": {
    // ...
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "composables": "@/composables"
  }
}
```

If you're using a different import alias prefix eg `~`, replace `@` with your prefix.

### Run add components

In order to perform Radix Vue to Reka UI migration easily, you can run `add` command for all your existing components.

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add <components>
```

If you're using custom component, you need to migrate them [manually](https://reka-ui.com/docs/guides/migration).

### New Component - Auto Form

[`Auto Form`](/docs/components/auto-form.html) is a drop-in form builder for your internal and low-priority forms with existing zod schemas.

For example, if you already have zod schemas for your API and want to create a simple admin panel to edit user profiles, simply pass the schema to AutoForm and you're done.

The following form has been created by passing a `zod` schema object to our `AutoForm` component.

These blocks are fully responsive, accessible, and composable, and are built using the same principles as the other components in `shadcn-vue`.
